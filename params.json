Resources are enriched using distributable tasks that provide informative reporting and monitoring. Before exiting the pipeline, resources are validated to provide quality assurance for downstream consumers. \r\n\r\n## Github \r\nThe latest source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/pipeline-project/scada), along with [release notes](https://github.com/pipeline-project/scada/releases) and a [README](https://github.com/pipeline-project/scada#scada) to get you going.","google":"UA-12975852-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
